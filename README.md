# Rock Paper Scissulator
`cargo run` should get things moving.

## TODO
- ~basically working~
- ~refactor into files~
- explicit system ordering to prevent movement jitter
- "simulation end" conditions, State
- entity acceleration
- better sprites and sprite animations
- convert-to animation (e.g. rock converting to paper)
- pause stack
- UI to control speed, entity quantity
- Do not spawn entities on top of each other
- entities face the direction they're moving
